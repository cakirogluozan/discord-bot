# Voice Connection Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
The bot is experiencing persistent 4006 errors when trying to connect to Discord voice servers. The error occurs after the voice handshake completes but before the connection is fully established.

## Error Pattern Observed
1. ‚úÖ Voice handshake completes successfully
2. ‚úÖ Endpoint found: c-fra16-e2ce8198.discord.media
3. ‚ùå WebSocket closed with 4006 (Session timeout/invalid)
4. üîÑ Discord library retries automatically (up to 5 times)
5. ‚ùå All retries fail with same 4006 error

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes:
1. **Discord Server Issues**: The specific voice server endpoint may be experiencing issues
2. **Network Connectivity**: Firewall or network restrictions blocking voice traffic
3. **Bot Token/Permissions**: Bot may not have proper voice permissions
4. **Discord Library Version**: Potential compatibility issues with discord.py 2.5.2
5. **Voice Server Overload**: The specific Frankfurt voice server may be overloaded

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Alternative connection methods
- ‚úÖ Connection issue tracking per guild
- ‚úÖ Force disconnect before reconnection attempts

### 2. Diagnostic Tools
- ‚úÖ `/voicefix` - Force disconnect and clear issue tracking
- ‚úÖ `/voicenetwork` - Test network connectivity to Discord servers
- ‚úÖ `/voiceinfo` - Show detailed voice client information
- ‚úÖ `/voicestatus` - Check current voice connection status
- ‚úÖ `/clearvoiceissues` - Clear all connection issue tracking

### 3. Alternative Connection Methods
- ‚úÖ Extended timeouts (45 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Multiple retry attempts with different parameters
- ‚úÖ Alternative connection strategies for 4006 errors

## Testing Strategy

### Step 1: Network Diagnostics
Run the network test to check connectivity:
```bash
python network_test.py
```
Then use `!networktest` in Discord.

### Step 2: Simple Voice Test
Test basic voice connectivity:
```bash
python simple_voice_test.py
```
Then use `!simpletest` in Discord.

### Step 3: Comprehensive Diagnostics
Run the diagnosis script:
```bash
python diagnose_voice.py
```
Then use `!diagnose` in Discord.

## Immediate Actions to Try

### 1. Check Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl -I https://discord.com
curl -I https://c-fra16-e2ce8198.discord.media

# Test voice ports
telnet c-fra16-e2ce8198.discord.media 443
```

### 2. Try Different Voice Channels
- Test in a different Discord server
- Test in a different voice channel
- Test with a different bot account

### 3. Check Bot Permissions
Ensure the bot has:
- Connect to voice channels
- Speak in voice channels
- Use voice activity
- View channels

### 4. Alternative Solutions

#### Option A: Use a Different Discord Server
The Frankfurt voice server (c-fra16) may be experiencing issues. Try:
- Using a different Discord server
- Waiting for Discord to resolve server issues

#### Option B: Network Configuration
If on a restricted network:
- Check if voice ports are blocked
- Try using a VPN
- Contact network administrator

#### Option C: Bot Token Issues
- Regenerate the bot token
- Check if the bot is properly invited with correct permissions

## Expected Outcomes

### If it's a Discord Server Issue:
- Network tests will pass
- Simple voice test will fail
- Solution: Wait for Discord to resolve server issues

### If it's a Network Issue:
- Network tests will fail
- Solution: Check network configuration

### If it's a Bot Permission Issue:
- Network tests will pass
- Voice connection will fail with different error codes
- Solution: Check bot permissions and token

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Commands to Use:
1. `/voicenetwork` - Check network connectivity
2. `/voiceinfo` - Get detailed voice client info
3. `/voicefix` - Force disconnect and clear issues
4. `/voicestatus` - Check current status

### Log Analysis:
- Look for "Voice handshake complete" messages
- Check for "4006" error codes
- Monitor connection attempt patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Run network diagnostics** to isolate the issue
2. **Test in different Discord servers** to see if it's server-specific
3. **Check Discord status** at status.discord.com
4. **Try alternative voice endpoints** if possible
5. **Consider downgrading discord.py** if it's a library issue

## Contact Information

If the issue persists:
- Check Discord's status page
- Report the issue to Discord support
- Consider using a different voice region if available
